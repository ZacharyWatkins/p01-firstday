         The class goes through the syllabus and over the dates of tests just like Jordan said they would. Finally, class ends and the teacher says he will email tomorrow to let you know of you got in. You text Jordan to see if he is still at the Bear, He replies that they had left but are thinking about going out later and asks you to come along.
