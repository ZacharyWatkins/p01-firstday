       <h1>Proving your lie</h1>
       <p>
        You start typing out your email explaining that you were on your way to class when someone hit you.
        You know however that your teacher is not going to simply believe your story without some sort of proof so you start
        thinking about ways to get proof. You could get old pictures from when your brother crashed his car, or risk it go out for the night.
