       <h1>Choosing Wisely</h1>
       <p>
         You find an image and attach it to your email and send it off hoping that your teacher will believe that you were in a crash. You wait staring at your phone hoping you will get a quick reply but nothing comes. The next morning you get a email saying that there is still no room in the class and you cannot get in.
