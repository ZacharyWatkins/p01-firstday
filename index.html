       <h1>First Day</h1>
       <p>
         It’s your first day at Chico State, you have your school supplies ready and are walking to class.
         As you are approaching your building, you run into your friend, Jordan. “Hey! Where are you headed?” he asks.
          “Just heading to my first class”, you reply. “A bunch of us are going to The Bear for lunch- come with us.
          It’s only the first day, nothing ever happens anyway” he says.
