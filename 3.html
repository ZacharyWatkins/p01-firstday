       <p>
         After your first glass you have a couple more and eventually you realize it is getting late.
         You say goodbye to Jordan and his friends and start walking back home.
         You notice that you have gotten an email from school so you check to see what it is about.
       </p>
       <P>Anyone who did not attend class today
        will be dropped to add waitlist students
        who did show up to class today unless you have a legitimate reason.
